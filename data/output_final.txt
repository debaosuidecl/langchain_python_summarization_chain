"Yelp! It's date night again! Creekside is jumping. Folks wants this barbecue. The fellas are holding down all the service tonight. And, they are doing an Amazing job! Way to go guys. I'm feeling all served. Bae got the spare rib dinner with fries and baked beans. Meat tasted good. Fries were delish. Baked beans were not as appetizing. They actually tasted straight out of a can with zero help or effort. I know there was attempted help, I saw the little bits of rib meat in them. I had the smash burger! When I say, this burger good. I paired it with fries and Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese was good, different, but good. Creekside is definitely worth a try. Oh, and them wings looked good. I have to come back for a bite."

Online travel publication Far & Wide recently featured two Birmingham BBQ joints on an article titled, “The Ultimate Road Trip for America’s Best BBQ“. With a title like “Ultimate”, you know it has to be good.

Far & Wide writer Jessie Fetterling’s recent article, “The Ultimate Road Trip for America’s Best BBQ“, features legendary barbecue joints in eight cities across the country:
1st Stop: Kansas City, Missouri
2nd Stop: Dallas, Texas
3rd Stop: Austin, Texas
4th Stop: Birmingham, Alabama
5th Stop: Columbia, South Carolina
6th Stop: Lexington, North Carolina
7th Stop: Memphis, Tennessee
8th Stop: St. Louis, Missouri
Who Made the List?
2 Men and a Pig — “Trendiest Joint”

First up on the list is 2 Men and a Pig. Far & Wide named this award-winning barbecue company as Birmingham’s “Trendiest Joint”. Since 2005, three lifelong friends—one of whom is nicknamed “Pig”—have been cooking up barbecue in The Magic City. Nowadays, 2 Men and a Pig offer up full service BBQ catering, food truck operations, vending, fundraisers, concession stand operations and more.
Here’s what Far & Wide had to say about 2 Men and a Pig:
“Some may doubt that delicious BBQ can come from a food truck, but those people likely haven’t tried 2 Men and a Pig. One Yelp reviewer writes, “THE MEAT BY ITSELF HAD FLAVOR!!!”
That’s all caps people — need we say more?”

Contact: Website | Call
Since 1984, Miss Myra’s Pit BAR-B-Q has been cooking up some of the best pit barbecue in The Magic City. The joint specializes in barbecued chicken, beef, pork, ribs, sausage and tons of homemade desserts and sides.
The folks at Far & Wide have been big fans of Miss Myra’s for years. In 2019, Far & Wide named Miss Myra’s its “top pick” for best sandwich in Alabama. Here’s what Far & Wide had to say about Miss Myra’s:
“Miss Myra’s is where the locals in Birmingham have been going since 1984. Not only does Miss Myra Grissom Harper make a killer white sauce that gives Big Bob a run for his money, but her smoked chicken and banana pudding are the stuff of dreams.
Oh, and don’t forget to taste the pie!”
What Makes Birmingham BBQ so Unique?

Although the trek from Austin to Birmingham is the longest leg of the trip, Far & Wide says Birmingham’s unique spin on BBQ is worth the drive.
And what sets Birmingham apart? It all comes down to the sauce. Building on the barbecue traditions of Tennessee and the Carolinas, Birmingham is famous for its unique Alabama White Sauce. Speaking of Alabama White Sauce, Miss Myra’s has shared their famous recipe with Bham Now in the past.
Here’s how to make it:
2 quarts heavy-duty mayonnaise ( the kind purchased at Costco’s or Sam’s)
1 quart white vinegar
2 tablespoons salt
2 tablespoons pepper
Slowly pour vinegar into mayonnaise, using a whisk to work out all the lumps. While whisking in vinegar, also mix in salt and pepper. Once all the lumps are gone, place mixture in refrigerator before serving to allow sauce to thicken.

Meat being barbecued at The Salt Lick restaurant
Barbecue or barbeque (informally BBQ in the UK, US, and Canada; barbie in Australia; and braai in South Africa) is a term used with significant regional and national variations to describe various cooking methods that use live fire and smoke to cook the food.[1] The term is also generally applied to the devices associated with those methods, the broader cuisines that these methods produce, and the meals or gatherings at which this style of food is cooked and served. The cooking methods associated with barbecuing vary significantly but most involve outdoor cooking.

The various regional variations of barbecue can be broadly categorized into those methods which use direct and those which use indirect heating.[1] Indirect barbecues are associated with North American cuisine, in which meat is heated by roasting or smoking over wood or charcoal.[2] These methods of barbecue involve cooking using smoke at low temperatures and long cooking times, for several hours. Elsewhere, barbecuing more commonly refers to the more direct application of heat, grilling of food over hot coals or a gas fire.[1] This technique is usually done over direct, dry heat or a hot fire for a few minutes. Within these broader categorizations are further national and regional differences.[2]
Etymology[edit]
Barbecued hickory-smoked baby-back pork ribs
A barrel-shaped smoker on a trailer. Pans on the top shelf hold hamburgers and hot dogs. The lower grill is being used to cook pork ribs and "drunken chicken".
The English word barbecue and its cognates in other languages come from the Spanish word barbacoa, which has its origin in an indigenous American word.[3] Etymologists believe this to be derived from barabicu found in the language of the Arawak people of the Caribbean and the Timucua people of Florida;[4] it has entered some European languages in the form of barbacoa. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) traces the word to Hispaniola and translates it as a "framework of sticks set upon posts".[5]
History[edit]
Spanish explorer Gonzalo Fernández De Oviedo y Valdés was the first to use the word "barbecoa" in print in Spain in 1526 in the Diccionario de la Lengua Española (2nd Edition) of the Real Academia Española. After Columbus landed in the Americas in 1492, the Spaniards apparently found Taíno roasting meat over a grill consisting of a wooden framework resting on sticks above a fire. The flames and smoke rose and enveloped the meat, giving it a certain flavor.[6]
Traditional barbacoa involves digging a hole in the ground and placing some meat—usually a whole lamb—above a pot so the juices can be used to make a broth. It is then covered with maguey leaves and coal, and set alight. The cooking process takes a few hours. Olaudah Equiano, an African abolitionist, described this method of roasting alligators among the "Mosquito people" (Miskito people) on his journeys to Cabo Gracias a Dios in his narrative The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano.[7]
Linguists have suggested the word was loaned successively into Spanish, then Portuguese, French, and English. In the form barbacado the word was used in English in 1648 by the supposed Beauchamp Plantagenet in the tract A description of the province of New Albion: "the Indians in stead of salt doe barbecado or dry and smoak fish".[8]
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first recorded use in modern form was in 1661, in Edmund Hickeringill's Jamaica Viewed: "Some are slain, And their flesh forthwith Barbacu'd and eat";[5] it also appears in 1672 in the writings of John Lederer following his travels in the North American southeast in 1669–1670.[9] The first known use as a noun was in 1697 by the English buccaneer William Dampier. In his New Voyage Round the World, Dampier wrote, "and lay there all night, upon our Borbecu's, or frames of Sticks, raised about 3 foot [0.91 m] from the Ground".[10]
As early as the 1730s, New England Puritans were familiar with barbecue, as on 4 November 1731, New London, Connecticut, resident Joshua Hempstead wrote in his diary: "I was at Madm Winthrops at an Entertainment, or Treat of Colln [Colonel] or Samll Brownes a Barbaqued."[11] Samuel Johnson's 1755 dictionary gave the following definitions:[12]
"To Barbecue – a term for dressing a whole hog" (attestation to Pope)
"Barbecue – a hog dressed whole"
While the standard modern English spelling of the word is barbecue, variations including barbeque and truncations such as bar-b-q or BBQ may also be found.[13] The spelling barbeque is given in Merriam-Webster as a variant, whereas the Oxford Dictionaries explain that it is a misspelling which is not accepted in standard English and is best avoided.[14][15] In the southeastern United States, the word barbecue is used predominantly as a noun referring to roast pork, while in the southwestern states cuts of beef are often cooked.[16]
Associations[edit]
Because the word barbecue came from native groups, Europeans gave it "savage connotations".[17]: 24  This association with barbarians and "savages" is strengthened by Edmund Hickeringill's work Jamaica Viewed: with All the Ports, Harbours, and their Several Soundings, Towns, and Settlements through its descriptions of cannibalism. However, according to Andrew Warnes, there is very little proof that Hickeringill's tale of cannibalism in the Caribbean is even remotely true.[17]: 32  Another notable false depiction of cannibalistic barbecues appears in Theodor de Bry's Great Voyages, which in Warnes's eyes, "present smoke cookery as a custom quintessential to an underlying savagery [...] that everywhere contains within it a potential for cannibalistic violence".[17]: 36  Today, those in the U.S. associate barbecue with "classic Americana".[17]: 3

In American English usage in the Southern U.S, grilling refers to a fast process over high heat while barbecuing refers to a slow process using indirect heat or hot smoke, similar to some forms of roasting. In a typical U.S. home grill, food is cooked on a grate directly over hot charcoal, while in a U.S. barbecue the coals are dispersed to the sides or at a significant distance from the grate. However in the Northern U.S. the term barbecuing includes grilling; for example in northern states barbecue fare often includes grilled hot dogs and hamburgers (which in the southern states would be considered fare for grilling or a cookout). In British usage, barbequeing refers to a fast cooking process done directly over high heat, while grilling refers to cooking under a source of direct, moderate-to-high heat—known in the United States as broiling. Its South American versions are the southern Brazilian churrasco and the Uruguayan/Argentine asado.[18]
United States[edit]

Main article: Barbecue in the United States
According to estimates, prior to the American Civil War, Southerners ate around five pounds of pork for every pound of beef they consumed.[19] Because of the effort to capture and cook these wild hogs, pig slaughtering became a time for celebration and the neighborhood would be invited to share in the largesse. In Louisiana Creole and Cajun culture, these feasts are called boucheries or "pig pickin's". The traditional Southern barbecue grew out of these gatherings.[20]
Each Southern locale has its own variety of barbecue, particularly sauces. South Carolina is the only state that traditionally includes all four recognized barbecue sauces, including mustard-based, vinegar-based, and light and heavy tomato-based sauces. North Carolina sauces vary by region; eastern North Carolina uses a vinegar-based sauce, the center of the state uses Lexington-style barbecue, with a combination of ketchup and vinegar as their base, and western North Carolina uses a heavier ketchup base. Memphis barbecue is best known for tomato- and vinegar-based sauces. In some Memphis establishments and in Kentucky, meat is rubbed with dry seasoning (dry rubs) and smoked over hickory wood without sauce. The finished barbecue is then served with barbecue sauce on the side.[21]
The barbecue of Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee is almost always pork, often served with a sweet tomato-based sauce. Several regional variations exist. Alabama is also known for its distinctive white sauce—a mayonnaise- and vinegar-based sauce originating in northern Alabama, used predominantly on chicken and pork. A popular item in North Carolina and Memphis is the pulled pork sandwich served on a bun and often topped with coleslaw. Pulled pork is prepared by shredding the pork after it has been barbecued.[22]
Kansas City-style barbecue is characterized by its use of different types of meat, including pulled pork, pork ribs, burnt ends, smoked sausage, beef brisket, beef ribs, smoked/grilled chicken, smoked turkey, and sometimes fish—a variety attributable to Kansas City's history as a center for meat packing. Hickory is the primary wood used for smoking in Kansas City, while the sauces are typically tomato based with sweet, spicy, and tangy flavors.
Pit beef prevails in Maryland and is often enjoyed at large outdoor "bull roasts", which are commonly fundraising events for clubs and associations. Maryland-style pit beef is not the product of barbecue cookery in the strictest sense; the meat is not smoked but grilled over a high heat. The meat is typically served rare with a strong horseradish sauce as the preferred condiment.[23]
The state of Kentucky, particularly the western region around Owensboro and Henderson, is unusual in its barbecue cooking; the preferred meat is mutton.[24] This kind of mutton barbecue is often used in communal events in Kentucky, such as political rallies, county fairs, and church fund-raising events.[21]
Barbecue in Texas is predominantly beef due to the state's historic ties to cattle raising. Barbecue sauce flavors vary by region but generally use tomato, molasses, or mesquite flavorings as a base. Tomato-based sauces tend to be typical of Central and East Texas while molasses-based sauces are more prevalent in the South. West Texas sauces tend to have a mesquite flavor.[25]
South Africa[edit]
Braais are informal gatherings of people who convene around an open fire for any occasion and at any location with a grill. They are linked to the consistent warm weather of South Africa that leads to much communal, outdoor activity.[26] The act of convening around a grill is reminiscent of past generations gathering around open fires after a hunt, solidifying the braais' importance to tradition.[27] Modernity has expanded grilling to the use of gas grills, but steel grill gates and campfires are often used.[27] The use of a gas grill is frowned upon and the use of charcoal is accepted, but wood is seen as the best method to cook the meat.[28]
It is expected that people attending a braai bring snacks, drinks, and other meat to eat until the main meal has finished cooking on the grill. This potluck-like activity is known as "bring and braai".[29] Cooking on the braai is a bonding experience for fathers and sons, while women prepare salads and other side dishes in kitchens or other areas away from the grill.[30] Examples of meat prepared for a braai are lamb, steaks, spare ribs, sausages, chicken, and fish.[26] Mielie pap, also known as "Krummel pap", is a crumbled cornmeal that is often served as a side dish.[31][26]
Heritage Day in South Africa, celebrated on 24 September, has also come to be known as National Braai Day, changed to Braai4Heritage, since the holiday is usually celebrated with one.[29] Desmond Tutu advocated for National Braai Day in 2007 due to the universal enjoyment of braais across races in South Africa, stamping it as a symbol of South African heritage.[31]
Techniques[edit]
Diagram of a propane smoker used for barbecuing
Barbecuing encompasses multiple types of cooking techniques. The original technique is cooking using smoke at low temperatures—usually around 116–138 °C (240–280 °F)—and significantly longer cooking times (several hours), known as smoking.[32][33]
A public barbecue site at a park in Oulu, Finland, on 23 March 2014
Grilling is done over direct, dry heat, usually over a hot fire over 260 °C (500 °F) for a few minutes. Grilling and smoking are done with wood, charcoal, gas, electricity, or pellets. The time difference between smoking and grilling is because of the temperature difference; at low temperatures used for smoking, meat takes several hours to reach the desired internal temperature.[34][35]

Smoking is the process of flavoring, cooking, and/or preserving food by exposing it to smoke from burning or smoldering material, most often wood. Meat and fish are the most common smoked foods, though cheeses, vegetables, nuts, and ingredients used to make beverages such as beer or smoked beer are also smoked.[36][37]
Grilling[edit]
Main article: Grilling
Lamb grilling over hot coals
Grilling is a form of cooking that involves a dry heat applied to the food, either from above or below. Grilling is an effective technique in order to cook meat or vegetables quickly since it involves a significant amount of direct, radiant heat. Outside of the U.S., this is the most common technique when cooking classic barbecue foods, although some variants of grilling require direct, but moderate heat.[38][39][40][41][42]
The words "barbecue" and "grilling" are often used interchangeably, although food experts argue that barbecue is a type of grilling, and that grilling involves the use of a higher level of heat to sear the food, while barbecuing is a slower process over a low heat.[43][44]
Other uses[edit]
The term barbecue is also used to designate a flavor added to food items, the most prominent of which are potato chips.[45]

HISTORY
In Alabama, some people call Barbecue a religion.  If this is the case, no family church of barbecue has been established longer than Carlile’s Barbecue. We opened in 1945, and 70 years later we are still serving up savory barbecue and desserts. 
Herman and Warren Carlisle opened Carlile Brothers after serving our country in World War II.  As for the misspelling of the last name, the founders blame it on the Armed Forces.  When Herman Carlisle had entered the service, his last name was misspelled as Carlile while his brother, Warren’s last name was spelled correctly. The brothers decided to use the Carlile version as the name for their new restaurant.
Today the restaurant is owned by the Collat Family. Carlile’s has served barbecue to famous political, civic, business and sports leaders. However, our foundation rests with hosting families and people just like you.

FUTURE
History is great.  However, serving your next meal is what commands most of our attention.  In 2007, the Collat family purchased Carlile’s Barbecue to preserve its history as a Birmingham institution, but also to build a future that includes you and your family. 
Customers can experience delicious food in what was once the founders home and gambling pub in Birmingham.

Carlile’s is thrilled have Maureen Holt as the Executive Chef and General Manager.  Maureen brings to much experience to Carlile’s as her previous life she was the restaurateur of Little Savannah Restaurant and Bar in Forest Park.  Maureen will be moving the nostalgic 1945’s restaurant into 2018 by creating menus with fresh herbs and vegetables through the Urban Food and Project adding her creative flare and Southern touches.
